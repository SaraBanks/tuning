# tuning
Python code for calculating all possible tunings that satisfy intervalic parameters. 
The program also provides Musical Set Theory analysis. 
Here is a crash course in Set Theory if you are unfamiliar.

The two concepts relevant to this project are Prime Form and Interval Class Vector.
The parameters to be input by the user are the permitted intervals and total span 
of possible tunings.
